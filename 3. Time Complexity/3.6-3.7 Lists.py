#3.6 Lists...

#making a list 4 different ways:

def test1():
    l = []
    for i in range(1000):
        l = l + [i]  # Concatenating a list with a single element

def test2():
    l = []
    for i in range(1000):
        l.append(i) # Appending a single element to a list
    
def test3():
    l = [i for i in range(1000)] # List comprehension

def test4():
    l = list(range(1000)) # Built-in function

#create a timer for each of the functions

from timeit import Timer
"""
 In this case the statement from __main__ import test1 imports the function test1 from the __main__ namespace into the namespace that timeit sets up for the timing experiment. 
 The timeit module does this because it wants to run the timing tests in an environment that is uncluttered by any stray variables you may have created, 
 that may interfere with your functionâ€™s performance in some unforeseen way.
