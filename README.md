## About This Book

This repository is dedicated to my journey through the book *Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python*. I'm learning as I go, exploring concepts and implementing relevant code examples from the chapters.

## Chapters and Useful Code

Throughout the book, I've found several chapters particularly insightful, and I've included code snippets that I found useful:

- **Chapter 3: Time Complexity and Big O Notation**  
    Examples of how to calculate time complexity and understand Big O notation.

- **Chapter 4: Basic Data Structures**  
    Implementation of stacks, queues, and linked lists.
